A physics-based puzzle game demonstrating real atomic structures through interactive orbital mechanics. Build authentic elements from Hydrogen to Oxygen by guiding electrons into their proper electron shells using electromagnetic fields. Fully optimized for JS13K competition at ~8.2KB zipped!

## Features

**Procedural Audio** - Musical chord progressions and sound effects from code alone  
**Real Atomic Physics** - Accurate electron configuration following Aufbau principle  
**Intuitive Controls** - Mouse-based electromagnetic field simulation  
**Educational Value** - Learn 1s, 2s, 2p-orbitals and quantum mechanical rules  
**Visual Feedback** - Orbital labels, rule violations, particle systems under 8.2KB!

## How to Play

- **Blue s-electrons** are attracted to your mouse cursor
- **Orange p-electrons** are repelled by your mouse cursor
- Guide electrons into matching colored orbitals to build atoms
- Follow real electron configuration rules: 1s² → 2s² → 2p⁶
- Orbitals glow red when they cannot accept electrons due to quantum rules
- **Two-hit knockout penalty** - Hitting an occupied orbital twice ejects the electron
  - First collision: Orbital shakes with audio feedback
  - Second collision: Electron is ejected and orbital becomes temporarily inactive (grayed out)
- Complete atoms by filling all orbitals according to the Aufbau principle
- Learn real atomic structure: H (1s¹), He (1s²), Li (1s² 2s¹), C (1s² 2s² 2p²), N (1s² 2s² 2p³), O (1s² 2s² 2p⁴)
- **Complete all 6 levels to earn a time achievement** - Your completion time is saved!
- **Press 'ESC' for Tutorial** - Learn controls and quantum rules
- **Press 'M' to toggle mute** - Experience procedural ambient music!

## Educational Elements

**Level 1: Hydrogen (H)** - Single electron in 1s orbital  
**Level 2: Helium (He)** - Noble gas, complete K shell  
**Level 3: Lithium (Li)** - Alkali metal, reactive due to outer electron  
**Level 4: Carbon (C)** - Basis of organic chemistry, forms 4 bonds  
**Level 5: Nitrogen (N)** - Essential for proteins and DNA  
**Level 6: Oxygen (O)** - Supports combustion, vital for life

## Technical Architecture

### Golfed Classes (Source → Build)

- `AudioSystemGolfed.js` → Class `A` (Procedural audio synthesis)
- `OrbitalSystemGolfed.js` → Class `O` (Atomic physics simulation)
- `ElectronGolfed.js` → Class `E` (Particle physics)
- `TutorialGolfed.js` → Class `T` (Educational overlay)
- `GameGolfed.js` → Class `G` (Main game coordination)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Development server on :8080
npm run build  # Build optimized game (~8.2KB zipped)
npm run size   # Check current size (alias for build)
```

### Build Output

```
Built file: 33587 bytes (32.8 KB)
Compression: 47.1% reduction
Estimated ZIP size: ~8.2 KB
JS13K budget remaining: ~4.8 KB ✅
```

## Post-Mortem

**My first completed game!** This JS13K practice project taught me:

- **Canvas 2D mastery** - Advanced particle systems, gradients, and visual effects without WebGL
- **Code golf techniques** - Terser optimization achieving 47% compression ratio
- **Procedural audio success** - Web Audio API generated all music and sound effects from code
- **Educational game design** - Balancing scientific accuracy with engaging gameplay
- **Community feedback value** - Playtesting revealed UX improvements that shaped my main JS13K entry

**Key challenges:** Learning build tools (Terser, minification), working within single-file constraints, and translating quantum mechanics into intuitive mouse controls.
