A physics-based puzzle game demonstrating chaos theory principles through atomic orbital mechanics. Guide electrons using electromagnetic fields to achieve stable atomic configurations. This is a practice game to learn and prepare for the js13k competition - a coding competition for web game developers with a strict 13KB size limit.

## How to Play

- **Blue electrons** are attracted to your mouse cursor
- **Orange electrons** are repelled by your mouse cursor
- Guide electrons into matching colored orbitals to complete each level
- Some orbitals rotate with gaps - time your movements carefully
- Click to advance to the next level when complete

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # Start development server
npm run build  # Build final game
```
